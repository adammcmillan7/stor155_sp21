## The rest

#### office hours, etc.

#### please read for yourself

## Course goals

---
class: left, middle
## Walk away from this course with

- data literacy: get more from and be more critical of the numerical and statistical information you consume

- ability to make basic plots and summaries of real datasets, in excel or python, and

- to understand the fundamentals of how probability shapes our world

- and of how a few common statistical models work

---
class: left, middle

## For example, we will address questions like

- if average income increases, what does that say about the economy?

- if I test negative what is the chance I actually am covid-free?

- how strongly related are air quality and weather? does one *cause* the other?

- generally: do the data justify the claims?

## See the syllabus for a list of topics

---
class: left, middle

## I'll strive to share diverse data and examples, e.g.

- greek life at Duke

- simulated physical processes

- national life expectancy across 50+ years

- air quality in my own living room

## We won't be covid obsessed

## but I can't ignore it

#### there is too much important stuff happening right now 
#### and this course can help you understand it at least a little better

# Homework and lectures

---
class: left, top
### Each week

.pull-left[
### Concepts homework: webassign

- **one-two**, usually a couple of days till due

- resource: https://webassign.net/

- class key to sign up: Sakai

- **daily help sessions:** 7-8 pm Sunday-Thursday, link to meeting on Sakai

- help sessions are for webassign or general course concepts, not data hw!
]

.pull-right[
### Data homework: excel or python

- **one**, usually due by Tuesday class

- resource: [course github](https://github.com/brendanrbrown/stor155_sp21)

- small exercises with real datasets

- **you choose** to do in excel (default) or python

- treated equally no matter the choice

- graded on how well you answer the Qs (with justification) not program used
]

class: left, top
.pull-left[
### Choose excel if you

- want to do well in the course without working more than needed

- **don't expect to use data much after this course**

- are weirded out about by having this choice

- **want more help**: from me or assistant
]

.pull-right[
### Choose python if you

- want to **work with data after this course**

- not just for math/stat majors! all disciplines can use data

- are **willing to put in extra work** for a bigger payoff: this skill can serve you for life

- **no help for installation/computer issues**

- **help from me (not TA) with coding needed for the class** in pandas and numpy (python packages)
]

### You can try one then switch, but I recommend settling on one after the first 2 weeks of class

---
class: left, top

### No extensions, except under exceptional circumstances (see syllabus)

### Lowest homework grade (across all) is dropped

### All data homework output must be clearly supported by your work

#### You do not need to do anything extra to do this

#### Automatic zero if any item in the homework is not supported by your own work

#### See the syllabus for details on what this means for excel/python

---
class: left, top
.pull-left[
### Tuesday: lecture

- **attendance required** (talk to me if in different timezone)

- recorded, links on Sakai

- start with lecture

- end with group exercise and quiz through poll.unc.edu
]

.pull-right[
### Thursday: data lab

- **attendance suggested**

- not recorded

- demo and help for data homework

- I start the homework, you finish

- **excel version:** 12:30-1:05 pm

- **python version:**1:10-1:45 pm

## Email me by 5:30 pm on a given day and you will get a response that day

#### if you email me later than that, most likely you **will not get a response** till the end of the next day

#### this is to preserve my sanity and ensure you have a reliable, predictable way to get my help

# Assessment and grades

---
class: left, top

### Midterms and final replaced with individual data-focused projects

Details in the syllabus and as deadlines approach

### Tests are not the best way to evaluate your knowledge in this course, in my opinion

Too many students will cheat on tests in an online-only environment. I would have to track them down and give them zeros, if not worse. I would not be lenient.

That would make me :-(

It would make you :-(

So let's be :-) and find a more constructive way to help you learn what's important in the class
