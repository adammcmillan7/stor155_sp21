# Looking at data

class: left, top

## Definition: sample distribution
>> The sample distribution of a variable tells us what values it takes and how often it takes these values in our dataset.


#### this is about the values a variable actually has in your data

#### does *not* tell you about all possible values your variable could have if you got more or different data

## Looking at sample distributions: depends on the variable type

.pull-left[
### Categorical:

#### bar graphs

#### pie charts

.pull-right[
### Numeric/quantitative:

#### histograms

## Looking at categorical data

### frequency statistics

- **frequency** of a category is the **number of observations** in that category
- **relative frequency** is number of **observations in a category / total** number of observations 

### bar graph

- bar height represents frequency or relative frequency for each category
- the frequency must first be computed

### pie chart

- area of a pie slice represents the relative frequency of a category
- these can be **hard to read** because areas are difficult to estimate by eye
- can be used **only for** counts adding to the total number of observations, or percentages adding to 100

## Example: Fake news on facebook

.pull-left[
### dataset

- data on Facebook popularity of posts by fake news websites in 2018
- identified and collected by Buzzfeed News
- [Biggest fake news hits on Facebook in 2018](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/facebook-fake-news-hits-2018)
- source: [Buzzfeed github site](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2018-12-fake-news-top-50)
- dataset on our course github page as well
]


.pull-right[
### observations and variables

- each row is represents an article
- `fb_engagement` is essentially number of likes post received
- `category` is a buzzfeed-created categorical variable

### There are too many weird small categories to show nicely, so I picked some I was interested in.

### but what does it look like if we isolate the most common posting categories?

## Sample distribution


.pull-left[
### categorical variables

- given by **relative frequencies** of each category
- think of it as the chance a randomly chosen observation falls in that category
- e.g. relative frequency of 0.1 for category 'A' means 10 percent of observations of type 'A' 
]
.pull-right[
### quantitative variables

- more complicated
- will evaluate by looking at **histograms**
]

---
class: left, top

## Histogram

.pull-left[
- breaks the range of the values of a quantitative variable into intervals (bins) of a given width
- displays only the frequencies or relative frequencies of the observations that fall into each interval
]
.pull-right[
- choose any convenient number of intervals of equal width
- but **choice of width might affect how you interpret the data**
]
