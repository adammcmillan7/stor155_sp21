## Definition: sample distribution
>> The sample distribution of a variable tells us what values it takes and how often it takes these values in our dataset.


#### this is about the values a variable actually has in your data

#### does *not* tell you about all possible values your variable could have if you got more or different data

## Looking at sample distributions: depends on the variable type

.pull-left[
### Categorical:

#### bar graphs

#### pie charts

### Numeric/quantitative:

#### histograms

## Looking at categorical data

### frequency statistics

- **frequency** of a category is the **number of observations** in that category
- **relative frequency** is number of **observations in a category / total** number of observations 

### bar graph

- bar height represents frequency or relative frequency for each category
- the frequency must first be computed

### pie chart

- area of a pie slice represents the relative frequency of a category
- these can be **hard to read** because areas are difficult to estimate by eye
- bar charts preferred usually

## Example: Fake news on facebook

.pull-left[
### dataset

- data on Facebook popularity of 50 most popular posts by fake news websites in 2018
- identified and collected by Buzzfeed News
- [Biggest fake news hits on Facebook in 2018](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/facebook-fake-news-hits-2018)
- source: [Buzzfeed github site](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2018-12-fake-news-top-50)
- dataset on our course github page as well
]


.pull-right[
### observations and variables

- each row is represents an article
- `fb_engagement` is essentially number of likes post received
- `category` is a buzzfeed-created categorical variable
