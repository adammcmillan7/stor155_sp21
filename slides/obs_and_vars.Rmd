## Big picture

### Our perspective: using data to learn about some aspect of the world

### Often trying to answer a specific question

#### but I say 'learn' because definitive answers can be elusive


### But what *is* data? And *how* do we use it to learn?

---

## Some terms to get our bearings

### *population*: group of people/places/things you hope to learn about

#### national economies, elderly U.S. residents, north atlantic right whales, cat pictures online ...

### *sample*: subset for which you have data. sometimes sample = population!

### *observation*: unit of a single element in data

### *variable*: characteristic of each observation in the data

## Easier to understand in spreadsheet aka 'dataframe' terms

.pull-left[
#### obvservation is a row 

#### variable is a column]

.pull-right[

## Example: measurements for a sample of irises
```{r}
set.seed(1305)
d <- iris[sample.int(100, 8), ]
knitr::kable(d, row.names = F)
```


#### what is an example of a variable?

#### what is an observation in the data?

## Kinds of variables

.pull-left[
### quantitative:

- numerical values for which arithmetic makes sense
- e.g. heights, weights, years, dates, counts
]

.pull-right[
### categorical

- places observation into one of two or more groups
- typically non-numeric but not always
- arithmetic operations do not make sense: "best" + "worst" = "best"?

### back to our example
```{r}
knitr::kable(d, row.names = F)
```


#### which variables are quantitative?

#### which are categorical?

### A trickier case! Don't let column names fool you.
#### world bank statistics of female life expectancy at birth by year, for select countries
```{r}
d <- read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brendanrbrown/stor155_sp21/main/data/wb_lifexpec.csv')
knitr::kable(head(d, 4), row.names = F)
```

### what is the
population?
sample?
observations?
variables?

## Try to think of data in these terms even when just reading about it

### When reading an article presenting information based on data, ask yourself

#### what kinds of variables do they need to make these statements?

#### what might be the observations in this dataset?

#### do they have data on the whole population or just a sample?

#### later we'll talk more about how to evaluate whether the data are 'good' or not

## Example

#### [Land-grant universities still profiting from indigenous homelands (High Country News)](https://www.hcn.org/articles/indigenous-affairs-the-land-grant-universities-still-profiting-off-indigenous-homelands)

>> In the course of a two-year investigation into how the United States expropriated nearly 11 million acres of Indigenous lands to build today’s celebrated land-grant university system, High Country News found that at least 16 land-grant universities in the West and Midwest — nearly a third of the schools in the system — still retain more than a half-million acres ... which generated at least $8.7 million in FY2019.
